 _This is not a product made by Microsoft and it's in no way related to them._
 

## Features 
ThisIsWin11 lets you customize Windows 11 all in one place. It is slowly expanded as a practical all-rounder for Windows 11 replacing some discontinued PowerToys components and adding additional ones.
 
**Included components**

- **GetStarted** ThisIsWin11 is starting off with a helpful introduction to what you can find in Windows 11. This component extends Microsoft's Get Started app.
- **OpenTweaks** allows it to customize the more obscure settings of Windows 11 system's UI. It replaces Microsoft PowerToys **[TweakUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweak_UI)** _(available from Windows 95 - Windows XP)_ which was no longer integrated into the relaunched PowerToys as of Windows 10.
- **PumpedApp** makes it possible to remove unwanted features and apps from Windows 11 such as the Camera and Alarm apps, and other preinstalled bloat that you can live without.
- **Packages** powered by [Windows Package Manager](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) allows you to create your own custom install packages.
- **PowerUI** allows you to apply automation capabilities based on PowerShell and community scripts.
 - **Extensions** allows you creating custom tweaks
